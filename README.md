<h1>Description</h1>
According to the World Bank Report, "Humankind currently produces two billion tons of waste per year between 7.6 billion people" This is very damaging and can be reduced through many different implementations. We hope to combat part of this problem by removing the factor of improper waste disposal. Have you ever been unsure of how or where to dispose of your garbage? ZeroWaste will tell you exactly how it should be disposed of with a simple scan using your smartphone's camera. Information from an uploaded photo will provide the user with the proper disposal protocols based on the object in focus on their provided image. Improper garbage disposal is a huge problem for the ecosystem and ZeroWaste would like to reduce the impact of environmental damage. For ZeroWaste we have used different technologies and allowed them to work together for our application processes. We have used Core ML to define our garbage sorting model which will take a user's image in order to define what kind of waste an object is and how it should be disposed. This information is sent to the user seconds after sending their image for processing. Furthermore, we have made use of Google Firebase to store information on region-based rules as well as our garbage categories. We believe that Firebase is a reliable cloud server for storing this information and it allows the application to run at a smoother pace since the app will take up less space on the users' device. Presently, our application is working with 10 garbage categories only, we wanted to make sure that our model will run smoothly before adding more categories. We wanted our model to appropriately address region-based rules and work properly at recognizing garbage categories before we moved on to improve our features and overall UX of ZeroWaste. In the future we hope to hash out these smaller issues and build on our app so that it is able to handle more garbage categories and work in a wider range of regions. We would like for our users to be confident that they are working with a reliable application that they can trust.
